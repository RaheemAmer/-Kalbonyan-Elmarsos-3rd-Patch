# Notes

  <summary>Programming Foundations: Fundamentals</summary>

bug - error - crash

order of steps is vital - 

after writing code on text editor, opening it won’t run the program, cause python is an interpreted language and to run it we need an interpreter to run it

Double-clicking does not run the Python Interpreter on the source code.

---

Three main ways to translate source code:

1. compile → write our code then compiler acts like translation server and compiles code and the receiver would never know the original code (Hight level compiled into low level machine language)  
    
    **EX → c, c++ and objective c** 
    
2. interpret → send code and then use someone who knows it to read every line (process source code line by line using interpreter)
    
    **EX → PHP and JavaScript**
    
3. combination
    
    **EX** → Java, c# and python
    

---

**Enhanced text editors (IDE - integrated development environments)**

IntelliSense→ help with suggestions while typing

---

syntax - the rules of programming language

syntax highlighting

run selected line to debug it

---

statements - expressions - operators

---

### Errors Categories

1. Syntax - language rules broken
2. Runtime - unable to execute (DivisonbyError)
3. Semantic - unexpected output (print alice - print name - print Name)

---

To get Python code suggestions, you need to tell VS Code which Python interpreter to use.

`2 * 3 + 2 * 5` → 16

---

`exit()` to make Python exit command-line prompt

---

computer gives us space in memory to store data using variables

---

java is a static typed language

python and Js are both dynamic = gets the data type from the stored value in the variable

---

python treats decimal as  floats in the most precise way while JavaScript no

---

conditional or Boolean expressions or relational operators, ==

```python
if 5 < 6:
	return True #block
else
	return False #block
```

---

```python
def testMe():
	
```

parameters - arguments

⚠️ void means a function doesn’t return a value
